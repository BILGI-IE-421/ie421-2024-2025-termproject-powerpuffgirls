**What is the possible impact of the transition to the use of electric vehicles in Turkey on air pollution?**

The rapid population growth and urbanization in Istanbul significantly impact vehicle traffic. This situation increases carbon emissions and air pollution. Since electric vehicles do not emit carbon, we foresee that they could have a mitigating effect on transportation-related carbon emissions. However, electricity production for charging these vehicles does contribute to carbon emissions. Considering these factors, the annual carbon emissions of vehicles will be analyzed and compared. The potential changes in carbon emissions when electric vehicles replace non-electric ones will be observed, and the number of vehicles will be estimated based on population growth.
