**1.	What is the possible impact of the transition to the use of electric public transportation in Istanbul on air pollution?**

Due to intense population growth and urbanization in Istanbul, more public transportation vehicles are needed. Increasing the number of vehicles to meet this need increases carbon emissions and affects air pollution. The carbon emissions of vehicles will be analyzed by year and the change will be estimated for the following years. Since electric vehicles do not emit carbon emissions, we predict that their integration into public transportation may have a reducing effect on carbon emissions in transportation. However, carbon is released during the production of electricity used by this vehicle. Considering these factors, first the number of vehicles in traffic will be predicted, and then the carbon emissions of normal vehicles and electric vehicles will be compared.

**2.	How did the use of rail system lines affect the highway traffic in Istanbul?**

Traffic is one of the most important urbanization problems. The use of the rail system is one of the effective solutions used to reduce traffic. The number of vehicles and the rail system usage data will be analyzed. Highway traffic is expected to decrease over time. As a result of these analysis, the location of the new line to be launched and the traffic density according to this line can be predicted.


**3.	Which metrics affect the traffic index in cities?**

Over time, countries have developed various methods to solve the traffic problem. Rail lines, public transportation, smart traffic lights, and congestion charge to city centers are some of the examples. To determine the success of these methods, a city-based examination will be conducted first. By analyzing the population density and traffic index, cities with high population density but low traffic density will be determined. Afterwards, the factors that improve the traffic density of these cities will be analyzed. Finally, the applicability and application result of these methods in cities with poor traffic management will be estimated.
